#Saim, an ImageJ/Fiji plugin
Saim is short for Scanning Angle Interference Microscopy.  It is a fluorescence microscope technique used 
to measure height differences with nanometer resolution.  The following publication describes it in full:  
Paszek, M.J., DuFort, C.C., Rubashkin, M.G., Davidson, M.W., Thorn, K.S., Liphardt, J.T., and Weaver, V.M. (2012). 
Scanning angle interference microscopy reveals cell dynamics at the nanoscale. Nat Meth 9, 825â€“827.

Here, I am hosting an ImageJ/Fiji plugin to perform the analysis described in Matt's paper.  The plugin is still 
in development, but can already be used to plot angle/intensity curves based on the SAIM theory, and to fit
experimental data.
